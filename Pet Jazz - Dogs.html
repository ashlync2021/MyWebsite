          <p>When getting a dog, you want to make sure that the dog is perfect for
             your family. There are many things that you will want to take into
             consideration when you are getting your new pet. You will want to consider
             the size of your house and yard when thinking of getting a dog. Some dogs
             will need a lot of space to play, run around, and let their energy out.
             You will also want to consider your youngest or oldest family member that
             lives in the house. Some small children or elders can accidently be injured
             by larger dogs; therefore, it is important to consider your family members
             when thinking about getting your dog. Lastly, you will want to consider your
             activity level. Some dogs can be quite energetic and will need to be played
             with or taken on a walk often. These are very important things to consider
             when you are thinking about adopting a your new dog.</p>
