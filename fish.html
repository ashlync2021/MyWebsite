          <h3>Home</h3>
          <p> It is a common misconception that bettas can thrive in small,
          unfiltered cups or vases. But in reality, for a betta to live happily,
          they will need a minimum of a 2.5 gallon tank. However, if you can invest
          in a 5 gallon, that would be best. When homing your betta, remember that
          they are solitary fish. Never put two male or female bettas in the same
          tank, they will be very aggressive and fight one another.</p>

          <h3>Water Quality</h3>
          <p>Betta are tropical fish, which means they will need a heater to keep
          their water temperature nice and warm. Cold or fluctuating water
          temperatures can leave your betta prone to illnesses and diseases by
          suppressing their immune system. You will also need to get a good
          dechlorinator to put in your bettas water to rid of the toxic chemicals
          such as chlorine, nitrates, and nitrites that are present in tap water.
          </p>

        <section>
          <h3>Diet</h3>
          <p>A good diet for your betta would consist of dried bloodworms, brine
          shrimp, and daphnia. Betta pellets are suggested because they contains
          all three foods, plus vitamins and minerals that your betta will benefit
          from. You can also feed your betta live bloodworms as an occasional
          treat. </p>

        <section>
          <h3>Home</h3>
          <p>When buying guppies, you should consider getting a group of a least
          five because they are schooling fish and feel more comfortable in
          groups. You will need a minimum of 5 gallons for a tank, it is suggested
          that you have at least a gallon per fish, when giving your guppies
          their new home. You can also put guppies in a community tank with other
          peaceful community fish due to their peaceful temperment.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h3>Water Quality</h3>
          <p>Unlike Bettas, room temperature water will be just fine for your
          guppies, but it is suggested that you keep the tank temperature around
          70 to 76 degrees for happier guppies. Like bettas, they need to have
          dechlorinated water to rid of harmful chemicals that are in your tap water.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h3>Diet</h3>
          <p>Guppies have a similar diet to bettas. They eat meat and algae based
          food. It'suggested that you use flakes instead of pellets as pellets can
          be too big for your guppy to eat.</p>

    <h2>Important</h2>
      <p>When cleaning your fish's tank, <b>never</b> use soaps or degergents,
      the chemicals will harm and kill your fish. Also, when putting your fish
      back into it's tank, it's important that you aclimate your fish by floating
      the cup in the water for a minimum of 10 minutes. If you immediately put your
      fish into your tank without alcimating them, you have the chance of shocking
      or severly stressing out your fish. Shock and stress can lead to the death
      of your fish.
