          <p>When getting a dog, you want to make sure that the dog is perfect for
             you and your family. There are many things that you will want to take
             into consideration when you are getting your new pet. You will first
             want to consider the size of your house and yard when thinking of getting
             a dog. Some dogs will need a lot of space to play, run around, and let
             their energy out. You will also want to consider your youngest or oldest
             family member that lives in the house. Some small children or elders can
             accidentally be injured by larger dogs; therefore, it is important to
             consider your family members when thinking about getting a dog. Lastly,
             you will want to consider your activity level. Some dogs can be quite
             energetic and will need to be played with or taken on a walk often. Other
             breeds of dogs can be very calm and arenâ€™t as energetic as other dogs.
             These are very important things to consider when you are thinking about
             adopting a new dog.</p>
